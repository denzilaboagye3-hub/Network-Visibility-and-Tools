Network Visibility & Reconnaissance Outline
Goal:
Develop hands-on experience with network visibility tools to identify exposed services, observe live traffic, and understand how basic reconnaissance supports both troubleshooting and security analysis.
Objectives:
By the end of this lab, I can:
•	Perform network reconnaissance to identify open ports and services
•	Explain potential security risks associated with exposed services
•	Capture and analyze network traffic at a basic level
•	Verify network configuration and DNS resolution
•	Clearly articulate tool selection and findings.
Tools & Purpose:
•	Nmap
•	Wireshark
•	Ipconfig
•	Nslookup
Environment:
Windows 11
What I’m looking for:
•	Open ports and associated services
•	Normal Network traffic patterns (DNS, ICMP, TCP)
•	Indicators of potential security risk from exposed services
•	Proper network and DNS configuration
Why This Matters:
Network visibility is a core skill in IT and cybersecurity. Understanding what is exposed, how devices communicate, and how to verify configurations is essential for securing systems and diagnosing network issues
